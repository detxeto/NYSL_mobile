				<h4>RULES OF PLAY &amp; POLICIES</h4>

				<h6>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</h6>


				<h5>SPORTSMANSHIP</h5>

				<ol>
					<li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
						youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship
						and fair play. Any player,
						coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
						detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
						technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
				</ol>

				<h5>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h6>DIMENSIONS.</h6>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
						within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
						dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>COMPETITION FIELDS
							.</h6>
						Fields used w
						ithin the competition program must
						be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.
						Leagues, districts or associations
						participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
						field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
						Competition
						Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
						field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
						dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
						associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field m
						ay be
						required to play all their games away.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>
							FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</h6>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<li>
						U
						-
						6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
						areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
					<li>
						U
						-
						8 plays on a field 40
						-
						50 yards in length and 20
						-
						30 yards width.</li>

					<li>

						U
						-
						10 play on a field 70

						dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
				</ol>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<h5>
							TEAM BENCH AREAS </h5>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Recreation &amp; District Programs <ul>


							<li>
								The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
								be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
								bench area shall consist of that area at least o
								ne (1) yard
								away from the touch
								line and extend
								ing to twenty yards (20)
								both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field
								2
								conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
								the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area tw
								o
								(2) yards away from the touch
								line and extending twenty
								yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</li>
							<li>
								The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
								locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
								to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
								and spectators should occupy the same s
								ide of the field as
								the team they are supporting</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li> State Competition League Only</li>

					<li>
						Except where it is determined by the referee to be
						impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
						touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
						outside the
						touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
						from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
						from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
						the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
						remain within their team's be
						nch area during the game.</li>
					<li>
						Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
						the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
						on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
						team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yard
						s on
						each side of
						the
						midfield that may not be occupied by
						parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
						enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
						games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
						spectator declines to abide by
						requests from match officials
						to comply with these standards.</li>
				</ol>

				<h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>We will abide by and accept equipment standards as defined by FIFA,

						ded that U

						the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
						received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
						which
						the offending participant would otherwise be eligibl
						e to participate.
						This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
						during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
						next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
						participate would
						otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
